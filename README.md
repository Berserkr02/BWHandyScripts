# BWHandyScripts
A few scripts I used in my efforts while playing The Black Watchmen

# Welcome, Agents!

To run these, you wil need Python, and know how to run it in a terminal.

Usually that's as easy as going to your command line and navigating to the folder and typing in

python theNameOfTheFile.py 

Here are some scripts that I threw together to try and solve some puzzles in the Black Watchmen game

I didn't necessarily SOLVE anything with them, but I tried. Sometimes I was successful.

They each contain an explanation and where I used them


# GOOD LUCK, AGENTS
